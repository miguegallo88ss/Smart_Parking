1. Problems:
	a) Printing and counting every time  car is in, it was proven that the pulse does its job
	   perfectly. 
    b)  Problem is with the Omega 2560 board and the timing. 
	
2. Solution:
	a) Tweak Omega 2560 board in order to synchronize the pulse and the loop running on Omega board 
	b) *** Solved by printing a "-" :
			if(val_2 == 1)  // car detected at the entrance 
			{
			   data.EntrancePulseFlag = true;
			   Serial.print("-");
			}
			
			if(val_3 == 1)  // car detected at the entrance 
			{
				data.EntrancePulseFlag = true;
				Serial.print("-");
			}
			
		Note: this added about 1uS to the total time it takes to loop.
